# RollDice
This is a library that I am using for testing and learnig how to use Kotlin. It is a simple dice roller library that I
will then test with an console application to see how much more I can learn.

NOTE: The dice roller is designed for RPG in mind such as D&D / Champions / Storyteller / ETC

IDie - Kotlin Interface which is base for Dice and Exploded.
    Dice - Simple Dice(D6) that extended IDie
    Exploded - Dice like above that can also exploded .. be rerolled again if the number is the same as the size

DicePool -- Class that will roll multiple dice at one time weather they are regular or can exploded

#SYSTEM

* NWOD - New World of Darkness - Dice Rolling mechanics are done for this system. I am not sure if these
         are up to spec with revised NWOD called Chronicles of Darkness
